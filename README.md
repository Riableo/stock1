Project that show a product list, on this app we can add, update, delete and list products.

I used SQLite by data persist, based on [flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/sqlite#1-add-the-dependencies "Link to example").

## Goals

- Data persist with SQLite
- CRUD's
- Navigation between screens and pass data each one
