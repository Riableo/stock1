# Product list 📝

Project that show a product list, on this app we can add, update, delete and list products.

I used SQLite by data persist, based on [flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/sqlite#1-add-the-dependencies "Link to example") and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLYoryuCOlM&list=PLAMfQH2NKM_sm2RZz_IWOGGRpTihdujgq&index=17 "Link to video") by **Luis Serrano Donaire**.

In addition, the app have a form validation for the register of new products and it uses an object with images of possible products.
